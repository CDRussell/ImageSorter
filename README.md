ImageSorter
===========

NOT YET READY FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION!! USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Setup your input directory (where your loose, unstructured images live) and the output directory in the config.properties file.

Sorts images into directories based on the EXIF date taken if available. 
Failing that, uses the date if it is in the filename (yyyy-MM-dd format only at the moment).
Failing that, uses the system last modified date instead.


Check out the wiki for a getting started guide.
